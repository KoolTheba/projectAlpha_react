## Project Alpha React ðŸ¦„ 
This project is meant to serve as a my showcase ðŸ’… and also as a reference for whoever wants to hone their React skills! ðŸš€

You'll find a series of practices, small and not-so-small pieces of code that will help you to sharp, step by step, all the coolest React, Hooks, Router, Testing, Styling and GraphQL features.

If you understand Spanish, you can follow the notes of the [React-GraphQL course](https://github.com/zamarrowski/Curso-React-Redux) by @zamarrowski and @Fictizia or along with any other course, you can also practice with all these proposals.

> I've realized that building a full application while learning React can be kind of overwhelming. ðŸ˜…

> So why not develop small pieces of code while being intelectually challenged? If the answer is 'yeah! let's go for it', this is your repo! ðŸ˜Ž
